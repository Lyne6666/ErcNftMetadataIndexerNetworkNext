# ErcNftMetadataIndexerNetworkNext

## Description

A Solidity smart contract suite for generative NFT projects, employing on-chain SVG rendering with dynamic metadata updates via a Merkle tree-based authorization system for efficient and trustless attribute modifications.

## Features

- Indexes ERC-721 and ERC-1155 metadata stored on IPFS using content addressing for efficient retrieval.
- Utilizes a distributed caching layer based on Redis to minimize latency for frequently accessed NFT metadata.
- Implements a GraphQL API for querying NFT metadata, allowing for flexible and efficient data retrieval based on specific criteria.
- Supports event listeners for on-chain NFT minting, transfer, and burning events to automatically update the index.
- Leverages a custom indexing algorithm optimized for large-scale NFT collections, achieving sub-second query response times.
- Deploys a containerized microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions like Filecoin for secure and verifiable metadata storage.
- Provides a configurable data pipeline for transforming and enriching NFT metadata with external data sources.
